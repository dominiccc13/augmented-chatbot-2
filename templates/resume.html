        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Personal AI Chatbot (FastAPI + Sentence Transformers)</strong>
        <a href="/">Try it here</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Architected a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using sentence-transformers to vectorize a curated dataset of professional and technical Q&A pairs, enabling grounding for an AI assistant</li>
            <li>Engineered a semantic retrieval engine utilizing scikit-learn cosine similarity to perform real-time vector searches against precomputed embeddings for high-accuracy context injection</li>
            <li>Optimized LLM performance by injecting retrieved context into OpenAI prompt templates, ensuring responses remained factually grounded in personal experience while mitigating hallucinations</li>    
            <li>Developed a resilient FastAPI backend featuring asynchronous request handling, CORS configuration, and custom IP-based rate limiting to manage API costs and prevent automated abuse</li>
            <li>Built a responsive vanilla JavaScript frontend with custom error handling for HTTP 429 (Rate Limit) and 500 status codes, providing a seamless, chat-like user experience</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Real-Time CV-to-Game Control Pipeline (MediaPipe + UDP + Pygame)</strong>
        <a href="https://github.com/dominiccc13/cv_pygame" target="_blank">See on Github</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a real-time obstacle-avoidance game using Python and Pygame, controlled entirely through hand gestures instead of a keyboard</li>
            <li>Implemented MediaPipe hand-tracking to detect open/closed hands, relative hand height, and directional gestures for player movement</li>
            <li>Built a UDP socket communication layer to stream gesture commands from the computer-vision module to the game loop with minimal latency</li>    
            <li>Designed a responsive gesture-mapping system supporting walking, sprinting, strafing, and directional control through intuitive hand motions</li>    
            <li>Engineered the overall architecture as two decoupled processes (vision + game), enabling modularity, smooth performance, and real-time interaction</li>    
        </ul>
        <strong>Full-Stack Secure Password Manager</strong>
        <a href="https://github.com/dominiccc13/local_pwm" target="_blank">See on Github</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed and developed a full-stack password manager with a Flask backend and a responsive front-end using modern HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, integrating CryptoJS for client-side cryptography</li>
            <li>Architected a relational SQLite database with multiple tables to efficiently store user and password metadata while maintaining strict data integrity</li>    
            <li>Implemented robust user authentication and validation workflows, including salted password hashing, encryption keys, and secure key management</li>    
            <li>Applied best-practice cryptography methods: all sensitive data (passwords, secrets, keys) encrypted/decrypted client-side; no sensitive information stored in plaintext on the server</li>    
            <li>Ensured secure client-server interactions and mitigated common web vulnerabilities</li>    
        </ul>
